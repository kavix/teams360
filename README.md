An open-source team health assessment platform inspired by [Spotify's Squad Health Check Model](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/09/squad-health-check-model/), designed to help organizations systematically improve team well-being and effectiveness.

## What is Team Health Check?

Team Health Check enables teams to regularly assess their working environment across multiple dimensions (mission clarity, delivery speed, code health, fun, etc.) using a simple red/yellow/green scoring system. The platform aggregates these assessments to help managers and executives identify areas needing support and track improvements over time.

### Core Philosophy

- **Support, Not Surveillance**: Health checks are a support tool, not a performance evaluation mechanism
- **"Red" Means "Needs Support"**: A red score doesn't mean "bad team" - it means "this team needs help in this area"
- **Trust-Based**: The system assumes honest input and encourages transparent self-assessment
- **Actionable Insights**: Focus on building team self-awareness and driving targeted improvements

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **11 Health Dimensions** | Expanded from Spotify's original 8 dimensions to cover more aspects of team health |
| **Hierarchical Organization** | Support for VP → Director → Manager → Team Lead → Team Member reporting chains |
| **Role-Based Dashboards** | Different views for team members, team leads, managers, and executives |
| **Trend Analysis** | Track health metrics over assessment periods (e.g., "2024 - 1st Half") |
| **Visual Analytics** | Radar charts, bar charts, and line graphs for data visualization |
| **Flexible Cadences** | Configure weekly, biweekly, monthly, or quarterly check-ins per team |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (for frontend)
- **Go 1.25+** (for backend)
- **PostgreSQL 17+** (for database)
- **Docker** (recommended, for running PostgreSQL)

### One-Command Setup

The easiest way to run Team Health Check locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/teams360.git
cd teams360
make run
```

This single command will:
1. Install all dependencies (if not already installed)
2. Start PostgreSQL in Docker (if Docker is available)
3. Run database migrations automatically
4. Start both frontend and backend servers
5. Display demo credentials for login

**That's it!** Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control or don't have Docker:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/teams360.git
cd teams360
```

#### 2. Start PostgreSQL Database

Using Docker (recommended):
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name teams360-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=teams360 \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:17-alpine
```

Or use an existing PostgreSQL instance and set the connection string.

#### 3. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Set database connection
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/teams360?sslmode=disable"

# Install dependencies and run
go mod download
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

The API server will start at http://localhost:8080

#### 4. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

### 5. Login and Explore

Use these demo credentials to explore different user roles:

| Role | Username | Password | Dashboard |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Vice President | `vp` | `demo` | /manager |
| Director | `director1` | `demo` | /manager |
| Manager | `manager1` | `demo` | /manager |
| Team Lead | `teamlead1` | `demo` | /dashboard |
| Team Member | `demo` | `demo` | /home |
| Administrator | `admin` | `admin` | /admin |

## Getting Started: Implementing Health Checks in Your Organization

### Step 1: Initial Setup (Admin)

Before teams can start using Team Health Check, an administrator needs to configure the organization structure. Log in as an admin (`admin/admin`) and navigate to the Admin Dashboard (`/admin`).

#### Configure Hierarchy Levels

The hierarchy defines your organization's reporting structure and permissions. Default levels include:

| Level | Position | Typical Role | Key Permissions |
|-------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Level 1 | 1 | VP/Executive | View all teams, view analytics |
| Level 2 | 2 | Director | View all teams, view analytics |
| Level 3 | 3 | Manager | View assigned teams, view analytics |
| Level 4 | 4 | Team Lead | View own team, take surveys |
| Level 5 | 5 | Team Member | Take surveys only |

**To customize hierarchy levels:**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Hierarchy Levels tab
2. Click "Add Level" to create new levels
3. Configure permissions for each level:
   - **Can View All Teams**: See health data across the organization
   - **Can Edit Teams**: Modify team configurations
   - **Can Manage Users**: Add/remove users
   - **Can Take Survey**: Participate in health checks
   - **Can View Analytics**: Access trend analysis and reports
4. Use drag handles to reorder levels (higher position = higher authority)

#### Create Teams

Teams are the core unit for health assessments. Each team has members and a designated lead.

1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Teams tab
2. Click "Add Team" and provide:
   - **Team Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Platform Squad", "Mobile Team")
   - **Team Lead**: Assign a user responsible for the team (optional)
   - **Cadence**: How often the team should complete health checks:
     - Weekly (high-velocity teams)
     - Biweekly (most common)
     - Monthly (stable teams)
     - Quarterly (strategic reviews)

#### Add Users

Create user accounts for everyone who will participate in health checks.

1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Users tab
2. Click "Add User" and provide:
   - **Username**: Login identifier
   - **Email**: Contact email
   - **Full Name**: Display name
   - **Password**: Initial password (users should change on first login)
   - **Hierarchy Level**: Their position in the organization
   - **Reports To**: Their direct supervisor (creates reporting chain)
3. After creating users, assign them to teams in the Teams tab

### Step 2: Establish Assessment Periods

Team Health Check automatically determines assessment periods based on the calendar:
- **January - June**: Surveys contribute to "Previous Year - 2nd Half" (reflecting on the period just ended)
- **July - December**: Surveys contribute to "Current Year - 1st Half"

This approach encourages reflection on completed work rather than in-progress activities.

### Step 3: Conduct Health Check Sessions

#### For Team Leads: Facilitating Sessions

Health checks work best as structured team discussions, not just individual surveys:

1. **Schedule a recurring meeting** based on your team's cadence (e.g., monthly for 1 hour)
2. **Before the session**: Remind team members to complete their individual surveys
3. **During the session**:
   - Review the aggregated results on the Team Lead Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
   - Discuss dimensions with significant spread (mixed red/yellow/green)
   - Focus on the "trend" arrow - are things improving or declining?
   - Identify 1-2 dimensions to actively improve
4. **After the session**: Document action items and track progress

#### For Team Members: Taking Surveys

1. Log in and navigate to Home (`/home`)
2. Click "Take Survey" to begin
3. For each of the 11 dimensions:
   - Read the "Good" and "Bad" descriptions
   - Select your honest assessment (🟢 Green, 🟡 Yellow, 🔴 Red)
   - Choose a trend direction (↑ Improving, → Stable, ↓ Declining)
   - Optionally add a comment for context
4. Submit the survey

**Tips for honest assessment:**
- Compare your current state to both the ideal ("Good") and worst case ("Bad")
- Consider the past assessment period, not just today
- Use the trend arrow to indicate direction of change
- Comments help explain context to your team lead

### Step 4: Review and Act on Results

#### Team Lead View (`/dashboard`)

Team Leads see detailed breakdowns for their specific team:
- **Radar Chart**: Visual overview of all 11 dimensions
- **Response Distribution**: Bar chart showing green/yellow/red spread
- **Trend Lines**: Historical view across assessment periods
- **Individual Responses**: Detailed view of each team member's input (for follow-up)

#### Manager/Executive View (`/manager`)

Managers, Directors, and VPs see aggregated data across their supervised teams:
- **Team Cards**: Quick health overview for each team
- **Radar Comparison**: Compare multiple teams on one chart
- **Aggregated Trends**: Roll-up trends across all supervised teams
- **Assessment Period Filter**: Focus on specific time periods

### Step 5: Drive Improvements

The goal isn't perfect scores—it's continuous improvement:

1. **Identify patterns**: Are multiple teams struggling with the same dimension?
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on 1-2 dimensions at a time
3. **Create action items**: Specific, measurable improvements
4. **Track progress**: Use trend lines to verify improvements
5. **Celebrate wins**: Acknowledge when dimensions move from red to yellow to green

### Best Practices for Adoption

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Start small** | Pilot with 2-3 teams before organization-wide rollout |
| **Consistent cadence** | Stick to your chosen frequency (biweekly works for most) |
| **Psychological safety** | Emphasize that red scores lead to support, not punishment |
| **Action-oriented** | Always end sessions with specific improvement actions |
| **Celebrate progress** | Highlight teams that improve, regardless of absolute scores |
| **Review quarterly** | Step back quarterly to assess overall organizational health |

## Health Dimensions

Teams assess themselves across 11 dimensions:

| Dimension | Good State | Bad State |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Mission** | We know exactly why we are here, and we are really excited about it | We have no idea why we are here |
| **Delivering Value** | We deliver great stuff! Stakeholders are really happy | We deliver crap. Stakeholders hate us |
| **Speed** | We get stuff done quickly. No waiting, no delays | We never seem to get anything done |
| **Fun** | We love going to work and have great fun together | Boooooring |
| **Health of Codebase** | Clean code, easy to read, great test coverage | Technical debt is raging out of control |
| **Learning** | We are learning lots of interesting stuff all the time | We never have time to learn anything |
| **Support** | We always get great support when we ask for it | We keep getting stuck without help |
| **Pawns or Players** | We control our destiny and decide what to build | We are just pawns with no influence |
| **Easy to Release** | Releasing is simple, safe, painless, and automated | Releasing is risky, painful, and takes forever |
| **Suitable Process** | Our way of working fits us perfectly | Our way of working sucks |
| **Teamwork** | We are a tight-knit team that works together well | We are individuals who don't care about each other |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env.local`):
```env
# Backend port (must match PORT set for the backend)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# SSO / OIDC (optional — omit these to disable SSO and use username/password only)
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://your-provider.com/oauth/authorize
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
NEXT_PUBLIC_OAUTH_SCOPES=openid email profile   # optional, this is the default
```

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):
```env
PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/teams360?sslmode=disable
GIN_MODE=debug  # or "release" for production

# SSO / OIDC (optional — must be set if frontend SSO vars are set)
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OAUTH_TOKEN_URL=https://your-provider.com/oauth/token
OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

### Configuring SSO (OIDC / OAuth 2.0)

Team Health Check supports single sign-on via any OIDC-compliant provider (Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, Google, Azure AD, etc.) using the **Authorization Code + PKCE** flow. Username/password login continues to work alongside SSO.

#### How it works

1. Register Team Health Check as a **Single Page Application (public client)** in your provider — no client secret is needed.
2. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (or your production URL) as an allowed redirect URI.
3. Set the environment variables listed above in both `frontend/.env.local` and `backend/.env`.
4. Restart both servers. A **Sign in with SSO** button will appear on the login page.

When a user signs in via SSO, Team Health Check extracts their `email` from the provider's ID token and looks up the matching user in the database. The user must already exist — Team Health Check does not auto-create accounts from SSO logins.

#### Provider setup quick reference

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Application type | Single Page App (SPA) / Public client |
| Client secret | Not required (PKCE flow) |
| Allowed redirect URI | `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` |
| Required scopes | `openid email profile` |
| Token claim needed | `email` (in ID token or access token) |

#### Loading env vars before starting

```bash
# Source backend vars (exports them so child processes inherit them)
set -a && source backend/.env && set +a
make run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mac ARM64 (Apple Silicon) Issues

If you encounter SWC-related errors:

```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .next
npm install
npm install --force @next/swc-darwin-arm64
```

### Database Connection Issues

Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible:

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Test connection
psql "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/teams360?sslmode=disable" -c "SELECT 1"
```

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Kill processes on port 3000 (frontend)
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Kill processes on port 8080 (backend)
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```
